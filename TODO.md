If you want, I can also:

✔ Update your background component to match the new aspect
✔ Polish the neon-border arcade look
✔ Add animated transitions between game pages
✔ Make the layout dynamically scale while keeping portrait ratio (like PWA arcade apps)

Would you like me to:
🔹 Add a slight glow border around the game view?
🔹 Automatically rotate landscape devices with “Rotate to play”?
